- Grassroots Advocacy: Facilitating calls to action, including letter-writing campaigns to elected officials to ensure that public opinion is communicated effectively.
- **Legal Education and Support:** Educating citizens on their legal rights and the process of filing lawsuits pro se, empowering them to advocate for themselves and their communities.
- **Fundraising and Data Access:** Raising funds to provide access to crucial voter data and a robust texting platform to enhance community communication and mobilization.
